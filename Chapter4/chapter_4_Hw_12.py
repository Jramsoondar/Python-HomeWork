'''The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period 
in a text file. The format of each line of the file is the following:
<last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a 
report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. The report should 
be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line should contain an 
employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.'''
